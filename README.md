# Computer Vision from Scratch with NumPy

prerequisites: Python3, NumPy, Pytorch

1. Canny Edge Detector (Sobel gradient, non-max suppression, edge linking, etc)
2. Image Stitching (Feature descriptor, approximately nearest neighbor, Hough voting, etc)
3. Classification (CNN, ResNet, etc)
4. Semantic Segmentation (Hypercolumn, transfer learning, etc)

## Visualization Results
